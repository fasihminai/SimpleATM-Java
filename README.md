# SimpleATM-Java
Simple ATM project in Java demonstrating OOP principles


A simple **console-based ATM program** written in Java demonstrating **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts** such as Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, and Polymorphism.

---

## Features

- **Login with PIN** (3 attempts max)  
- **Check Account Balance**  
- **Deposit Money**  
- **Withdraw Money**  
- **Exit Program**  
- **Simple console-based interface** — easy to use  

---

## OOP Concept Used

### Encapsulation
- PIN and balance are private variables
- Access is controlled through public methods

---

## Usage

1. Enter your PIN (default: 1234).  
2. If wrong PIN is entered 3 times, the program will block access.  
3. Choose from the menu to check balance, deposit, withdraw, or exit.

---

## Future Improvements

- Multiple account support with transfer between accounts
- Input validation for negative numbers
- Hiding PIN input while typing
- GUI version for better user experience
